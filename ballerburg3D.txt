Core Game Flow:

Initialization → Terrain generation with two mountains → Castle & cannon creation → Game start
Turn Loop → Player aims cannon → Charges power → Fires → Projectile physics → Impact/explosion → Damage calculation → Next turn
Win Condition → Castle destroyed → Victory screen → Restart option
